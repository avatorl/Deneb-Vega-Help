# Deneb Vega Help

Do you need help with Deneb custom visual for Power BI and/or Vega visualization grammar?

[➡️ Create an issue](https://github.com/avatorl/Deneb-Vega-Help/issues/new) to get assistance.

_*My assistance here is free of charge. However, consider the size of your request. If your requirements are significant, consulting may be more appropriate. If you're unsure whether your inquiry falls under the umbrella of "free assistance," feel free to ask._

## How to Get Your Question Answered Fast?

### Get familiar with the initiative
Visit [Deneb Support](https://deneb-viz.github.io/support) page for more details about the Deneb Support initiative and contact information for other Deneb/Vega/Vega-Lite experts.

### Do some research
Before creating a new issue, check the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/avatorl/Deneb-Vega-Help/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to see if someone else has already solved a similar issue.

Don't forget about other ways to find an existing solution (Google it!).

### Come prepared
Be prepared to clearly describe what you're trying to achieve and the problem; be as descriptive as possible.

### Provide
If you have drafted a Vega specification, please provide it (or at least a relevant fragment).

For more complex issues, if you can share a .pbix file that includes your Deneb/Vega visualization, share it. If you can't share a .pbix file, share the Vega specification (.json file) and a data sample (.csv file). If you can't make the files public, email them to me privately at andrzej@powerofbi.org.

## Vega or Vega-Lite?

Vega-Lite is a syntax sugar for Vega. Vega-Lite has somewhat limited capabilities. I do not work with Vega-Lite; I prefer the full functionality of Vega. Feel free to ask any questions regarding Vega.

Vega-Lite compiles its specifications to Vega specifications, so if you have Vega-Lite code but are okay with converting it into Vega code (there is no easy way back from Vega to Vega-Lite), let me know.

Ask other [community experts](https://deneb-viz.github.io/support) if your question is exclusively about Vega-Lite.
