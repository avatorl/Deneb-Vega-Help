# Deneb-Vega-Help

I've joined Deneb Support initiative.

Create an issue to get help with Deneb/Vega data visualizations. 

## How to Get Your Question Answered Fast?

### Get familiar with the initiative

Read https://deneb-viz.github.io/support for more details about the initiative and contact information for other Deneb/Vega/Vega-Lite experts

### Do some research
Before creating an issue here, check to see if someone else has solved a similar issue.

### Come prepared
Be prepared to clearly describe what you're trying to achieve and the problem; be as descriptive as possible.

### Provide
If you have drafted a Vega specification, please provide it. If you can share a .pbix file that includes your Deneb/Vega visualization, share it. If you can't share a .pbix file, share the Vega specification (.json file) and a data sample (.csv file).

## Vega or Vega-Lite?

I do not work with Vega-Lite; I prefer the full functionality of Vega.
Feel free to ask any questions regarding Vega, but I'll have to ignore Vega-Lite questions simply because I have never attempted to learn it.
Vega-Lite compile its specifications to Vega specifications, therefore if you have Vega-Lite code but are okay with converting it into Vega code, let me know.
