# Deneb-Vega-Help

I've joined Deneb Support initiative.

Do you need help with Deneb/Vega data visualizations? I'm ready to provide free assistance.

Create an issue to get help with Deneb/Vega data visualizations.

Just consider the size of your request. If your requirements are significant, consulting may be more appropriate.
If unsure whether your inquiry falls under the umbrella of "free assistance", feel free to ask.

## How to Get Your Question Answered Fast?

### Get familiar with the initiative

Read https://deneb-viz.github.io/support for more details about the initiative and contact information for other Deneb/Vega/Vega-Lite experts

### Do some research
Before creating an issue here, check to see if someone else has solved a similar issue.

### Come prepared
Be prepared to clearly describe what you're trying to achieve and the problem; be as descriptive as possible.

### Provide
If you have drafted a Vega specification, please provide it. If you can share a .pbix file that includes your Deneb/Vega visualization, share it. If you can't share a .pbix file, share the Vega specification (.json file) and a data sample (.csv file).

## Vega or Vega-Lite?

I do not work with Vega-Lite; I prefer the full functionality of Vega.
Feel free to ask any questions regarding Vega, but I'll have to ignore Vega-Lite questions simply because I have never attempted to learn it.
Vega-Lite compile its specifications to Vega specifications, therefore if you have Vega-Lite code but are okay with converting it into Vega code, let me know.
